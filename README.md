# Hired

A website for finding jobs in tech.

Just a few things about how this project is being developed:

-Vanilla CSS, Flexbox, Grid and media queries for responsive design, also I used some simple nesting using the nesting selector "&" for support in older browser versions.
-The HTML was written using "B.E.M" (Block Element Modifier) methodology, for better code readability, organization and to avoid problems with specificity
-Semantic HTML procuring web accessibility for assistive technologies.

Will keep updating the project
